This repo provides a minimal implementation of the 2-chain variant of the HotStuff consensus protocol. The codebase has been designed to be small, efficient, and easy to benchmark and modify. It has not been designed to run in production but uses real cryptography ([dalek](https://doc.dalek.rs/ed25519_dalek)), networking ([tokio](https://docs.rs/tokio)), and storage ([rocksdb](https://docs.rs/rocksdb)).

## Quick Start
HotStuff is written in Rust, but all benchmarking scripts are written in Python and run with [Fabric](http://www.fabfile.org/).
To deploy and benchmark a testbed of 4 nodes on your local machine, clone the repo and install the python dependencies:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/asonnino/hotstuff.git
$ cd hotstuff/benchmark
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You also need to [install tmux](https://linuxize.com/post/getting-started-with-tmux/#installing-tmux), which runs all nodes and clients in the background.
Finally, run a local benchmark using fabric:
```
$ fab local
```
This command may take a long time the first time you run it (compiling rust code in `release` mode may be slow) and you can customize a number of benchmark parameters in `fabfile.py`. When the benchmark terminates, it displays a summary of the execution similarly to the one below.
```

## Next Steps
The [wiki](https://github.com/asonnino/hotstuff/wiki) documents the codebase, explains its architecture and how to read benchmarks' results, and provides a step-by-step tutorial to run [benchmarks on Amazon Web Services](https://github.com/asonnino/hotstuff/wiki/AWS-Benchmarks) accross multiple data centers (WAN).
